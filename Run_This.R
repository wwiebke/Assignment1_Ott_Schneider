cool first assignment!

# change the directory above to your local director to run this file through


# This file runs two different datasets

# The first datset looks at the heights and weights of US women
# Please see women.R for the R script

source('women.R') #Here is our dynamic link to that R script

#####################################################################
# The second dataset looks at the average annual precipitaion of 70 #
# cities in the US as calculated in 1975.
#####################################################################

data(precip) # this dataset comes preloaded into R
names(precip) # lists the 70 US cities
?precip # to learn more information about this dataset

summary(precip) 
# but no one outside the US works with inches, let's convert to centimeters!

precip_cm <- precip*2.54 # precip_cm will be the focus from now on

summary(precip_cm) # the output of the summary

# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
# 7.00   29.38   36.60   34.89   42.77   67.00 

# Plotting a historgram
hist(precip_cm,
     main='Average Rainfall of 70 US Cities in 1975',
     xlab='Precipation in Centimeters')

# The distribution appears to be somewhat normal,
# though further analysis is needed.

#Looking at variation in the data
var(precip_cm)
sd(precip_cm)

# Plotting a boxplot
boxplot(precip_cm,
        main='Boxplot of Annual Average Rainfall by US City',
        ylab='Average in Centimeters',
        col = "lightgray"
        )

# In the boxplot, it's clear that there is bunching around the median (92cm)
# In fact, most cities have an average annuall rainfal between 74 and 109cm
# There are a few outliers present that you can see,
# on the outskirts outside the whiskers.
# To explore these further, let's use the boxplot.stats command....

boxplot.stats(precip_cm)
#This command shows the breakdown of the boxplot.
#stats shows the lower whisker, the bottom of the box, the median,
# the upper part of the box, and the upper whisker.
#n shows the number of observations (70)
# out shows the data that lie outside of the whiskers
# these are potential outliers, it's not suprising that Mobile, AL
# tops the list with the most average annual rainfall and that four
# desert cities are at the bottom (Pheonix, Reon, Albuquerque, and El Paso)
